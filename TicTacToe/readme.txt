/*
    things to do for easier implementation
    first print welcome to tictactoe
    then ask for the names of the players
    then randomly ask anyone to choose first and assign another automatically
    then the game starts

    ask the first player to make a move by choosing number from 1-9
    if a player chooses occupied position ask the person again to enter valid position
    then ask 2nd player to move
    then 2nd player chooses a position and place the symbol of this player accordingly
    always check for valid positions
    every time a move is made print the resulting board to help next player to move

    once you get 3 similar values in any row,column or diagonal print the corresponding player to have won the game
    and game ends

    ask both the users whether to play or not and both the players should accept for next turn to continue the game
